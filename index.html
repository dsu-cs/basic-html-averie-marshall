            <p>
                The Canada Lynx is a medium sized wild cat that lives across most of northern North America. 
                It is listed as "Least Concern" by the IUCN. It can weight anywhere from roughly around 15 to 30 pounds.
                It is known for having large feet  and large hind legs for a cat, which help it be a successful predator.
                The lynx can grow to be up to 35 inches long as well!
