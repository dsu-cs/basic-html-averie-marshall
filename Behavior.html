        <h1>Behavior</h1>
            <p>Lynx are solitary animals. They rely on stealth
            and surprise to catch their prey. They are mostly nocturnal. They can also climb trees!
            The only time they seem to consistently socialize is for mating season which is in late winter.
            </p>

                Lynx kittens are highly playful and dependent on their mother for almost a year. They partake 
                in social play such as wrestling and chasing each other. When they are just 2-3 months old they begin
                to learn to hunt by watching their mother. They are born in litters of 1-5, and sometimes even up to 6-8 when food is abundant!
